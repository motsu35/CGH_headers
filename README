This is a crude compilation of code from different projects with different formatting. hopefully in the next few days i can clean up the code, add more comments, and start adding more recent, better code.

CGH_headers:
	CGH_io.h:
		this contains functions relating to output on the console window.
		write(string or char, int x_position,int y_position,color Foreground = white, color Background = black)
		setCursorSize(int 0-100) (less than or equal to 0 will hide)
		setConsoleTitle(const char*)
		
		another function, resizeConsole(int x, int y) is also included, but to use you need to #define RESIZEWINDOW. beaware that it will change _WIN32_WINNT to 0x0500 (see msdn article)
		
	cgh_tools.h:
		general code that is nice to have.
		explode(string,char exploder) returns an array of strings, not good to use unless you have a known formatted string going in. as you have no way of knowing the returned length of the array.
		explode_v(string, char exploder) same as above, but will return a vector, to remove any problems that explode could cause. use this over the first one.
		startProcess(string path) starts a process
		startProcessHidden(string path) same as above, but the console window will be hidden.
		
		also defines min(a,b) max(a,b) random(a,b).
		
	cgh_network_raw:
		synchronous server / client code. it was created to demonstrate a "hello world" in winsock. feel free to use it, but its not anything special.
		that being said, the server socket class has two nice functions, GetHostName() and GetLocalIP() both do exactly what you think they will.
		
	cgh_network_irc:
		some irc code that is nice to have. the documentation is inside of the documentation folder.
